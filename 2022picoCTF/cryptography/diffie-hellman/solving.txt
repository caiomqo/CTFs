Diffie-Hellman

p = 13
g = 5

a = 7
b = 3

Alice sent text with letters and digits using the
generated key as the shift amount for a Caesar cipher
over the alphabet and decimal digits.

A = g^a mod p
A = 5^7 mod 13
A = 8 (Public)

B = g^b mod p
B = 5^3 mod 13
B = 8 (Public)

K = B^a mod p
K = 8^7 mod 13
K = 5

K = A^b mod p
K = 8^3 mod 13
K = 5

Used 5 to decode Caesar Cipher.
